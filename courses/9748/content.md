# 3b. Advanced navigation

Silver and Gold are where navigation gets serious. This course teaches you how to read the 'bones' of the land — using knolls, valleys, and ridges to find your way across open terrain. Combined with practical experience, you will master high-precision compass work and advanced strategies like aiming off to reach targets that aren't on any path. This is about total independence and the skill to lead yourself and others through challenging Scottish environments like a pro.

## Knowledge check

A quick check to see if your foundations are still solid. If they aren't, we recommend you also take the Navigation Foundations course.

### Lesson: The Silver mindset — leaving the path

<!-- duration: 3 -->

At Bronze level you followed paths and tracks. You used handrails, catching features, and the five Ds to navigate between clear waypoints. That was **path-based navigation** — and it works brilliantly in lowland terrain.

Silver is different. Your DofE Silver expedition takes you into **open country** — Scottish moorland, remote glens, and featureless hillsides where there are no paths to follow. The map is still your primary tool, but now you need to read the shape of the land itself.

The standard expected at Silver is higher too. At Bronze, getting to roughly the right area was good enough. At Silver, you need **precision** — the ability to hit a specific point on a hillside, even in poor visibility.

This course builds on everything you learned at Bronze. If any of the following feel unfamiliar, go back and complete the Navigation Foundations course first:

- Reading OS map symbols (paths, tracks, area features)
- Giving a six-figure grid reference
- Setting your map with a compass
- The five Ds of a navigation leg
- Handrails and catching features

> **Key point:** Silver navigation means leaving the paths behind. You need to read the ground, not just the map.

<!-- MEDIA-TODO: Split photo contrasting a clear lowland path (Bronze) with featureless Scottish moorland (Silver) -->

### Lesson: The symbol and scale challenge

<!-- duration: 5 -->

Before moving on, let's sharpen your Bronze skills with a rapid-fire drill.

At Silver level you need to identify OS symbols **instantly** — not after squinting at the legend for thirty seconds. The most important symbols for open-country navigation are:

- **Contour lines** — you'll be reading these constantly. Can you spot the difference between 5m and 10m intervals at a glance?
- **Paths and tracks** — even in open country, a faint path can be a lifeline. Single dashed line (path) versus double dashed line (track).
- **Water features** — burns, lochs, and marshland. These are your most reliable landmarks when everything else looks the same.
- **Boundaries** — walls, fences, and deer fences. In Scotland these often mark estate boundaries and can be followed as handrails.
- **Point features** — cairns, spot heights, trig points, and bothies. These become your targets and attack points.

Scale awareness matters more at Silver too. When you're navigating a bearing across 800m of open moorland, a small error in your distance estimate can put you in completely the wrong place. Practise measuring distances on the map until you can do it quickly and accurately.

> **Key point:** At Silver level, symbol recognition and distance measurement need to be fast and automatic.

<!-- MEDIA-TODO: Flashcard-style graphics showing contour lines, path/track, burn, wall/fence, cairn, trig point, and bothy symbols -->

### Lesson: Six-figure precision drill

<!-- duration: 6 -->

At Silver, a six-figure grid reference isn't just useful — it's essential. Mountain rescue, your supervisors, and your teammates all depend on your ability to give an accurate position quickly.

The drill is simple: speed and accuracy.

1. Pick a point feature on the map (a cairn, a spot height, a bothy).
2. Read the six-figure grid reference as fast as you can.
3. Check your answer. Were you within one tenth on each axis?

Common mistakes to watch for:

- **Swapping eastings and northings** — always go 'along the corridor' first.
- **Misreading the grid line number** — double-check which line you're reading from.
- **Rounding errors** — if the point is right on the boundary between two tenths, pick the nearest. Don't guess.

Use your roamer for every reference until you can estimate tenths reliably by eye. In the field, speed matters — you don't want to be fumbling with your compass while the weather closes in.

> **Key point:** Practise six-figure grid references until they're fast and automatic. Accuracy saves lives.

<!-- MEDIA-TODO: Two or three Scottish OS map extracts with point features (cairn, bothy, spot height) for grid reference practice -->

### Lesson: Setting and orientation audit

<!-- duration: 4 -->

At Bronze you learned to set your map using 'red to the shed.' At Silver, you need to verify your orientation constantly — especially when visibility drops.

Try this test: look at a landscape photo taken from a known viewpoint. Now look at four rotated versions of the same map snippet. Only one is correctly oriented to match the photo. Can you pick the right one?

The key checks are:

- **Horizon features** — do the hills on the skyline match the contour shapes on the map?
- **Water features** — is the burn or loch in the right position relative to you?
- **Linear features** — do walls, fences, or tracks run in the direction the map shows?

If your map doesn't match what you see, something is wrong. Either the map isn't set correctly, or you aren't where you think you are. Both problems need fixing before you walk another step.

> **Key point:** Constantly check that your map matches the landscape. If it doesn't, stop and fix the problem.

<!-- MEDIA-TODO: Scottish landscape photo from a known viewpoint alongside four rotated OS map snippets -->

### Lesson: The five Ds assessment

<!-- duration: 6 -->

This is your final Bronze audit. You'll be given a map with a marked leg and asked to write out the five Ds in full.

For Silver, the description needs to be much more detailed than at Bronze. Instead of 'follow the path north,' you should write something like: 'Head north on a bearing of 350° across open moorland. After 400m, cross a burn running east–west. The ground rises gently for 200m to a knoll with a cairn on the summit.'

The five Ds at Silver level:

1. **Destination** — a precise point, not just 'the next junction.' Give a six-figure grid reference.
2. **Distance** — measured to the nearest 100m.
3. **Direction** — a compass bearing, not just 'north-ish.'
4. **Description** — terrain, gradient, features you'll pass, and what the destination looks like.
5. **Dangers** — specific hazards: crags, bogs, burns in spate, steep ground, poor visibility.

> **Key point:** At Silver, the five Ds need precision. Vague descriptions won't keep you safe in open country.

### Quiz: The gatekeeper

#### Give the six-figure grid reference for the cairn marked on the map.

<!-- type: image_answering -->
<!-- MEDIA-TODO: Scottish OS map extract with a cairn symbol clearly visible in a grid square -->

> **Explanation:** Read the easting and estimate tenths across, then the northing and estimate tenths up. At Silver level, this must be accurate to within one tenth on each axis.

#### Which of these is NOT a linear symbol on an OS map?

<!-- type: single_choice -->

- Path (single dashed line)
- Track (double dashed lines)
- * Spot height
- Fence

> **Explanation:** A spot height is a point symbol marking a single location with its elevation. Paths, tracks, and fences are all linear symbols.

#### A burn is shown on the map running east to west. You are facing north. Where should the burn appear relative to you?

<!-- type: single_choice -->

- In front of you
- Behind you
- * Running left to right across your path
- Running right to left across your path

> **Explanation:** If you're facing north and the burn runs east–west, it crosses your path from left (west) to right (east).

#### Put the five Ds in the correct order for planning a navigation leg.

<!-- type: ordering -->

1. Destination
2. Distance
3. Direction
4. Description
5. Dangers

> **Explanation:** Identify where you're going first, then measure how far, work out the bearing, describe the terrain, and finally note the hazards.

## Reading the ground

How to navigate when there are no paths. This topic teaches you to read the shape of the land from the map and match it to what you see around you.

### Lesson: The small stuff (knolls and re-entrants)

<!-- duration: 7 -->

In open country, the big features — summits, valleys, ridges — are easy to spot. But Silver navigation depends on reading the **small stuff**: the subtle bumps and folds that most people walk straight past.

Two features to master:

**Knolls** are small, rounded hills — often just ten or twenty metres higher than the surrounding ground. On the map, they appear as one or two small closed contour rings, sometimes with a spot height. On the ground, they're gentle bumps that you might not even notice unless you're looking for them.

Knolls are incredibly useful for navigation. They're like natural waypoints scattered across the moorland. If you can identify a knoll on the map and then find it on the ground, you know exactly where you are.

**Re-entrants** are small, shallow valleys — folds in the hillside where water collects and trickles downhill. On the map, they appear as small V-shapes in the contour lines, pointing uphill. On the ground, they look like gentle dips or gullies.

Re-entrants are useful because they're everywhere on Scottish hillsides. Even on a featureless slope, there are usually re-entrants you can identify and use as checkpoints.

> **Key point:** Knolls and re-entrants are the 'GPS waypoints' of open country. Learn to spot them on the map and on the ground.

<!-- MEDIA-TODO: OS 1:25,000 map showing knoll contours alongside a drone or hillside photo of the same knoll in Scotland -->

### Lesson: Slope profiles (convex and concave)

<!-- duration: 6 -->

Not all slopes are the same. The **profile** of a slope — whether it curves outward or inward — affects what you can see and how you navigate.

**Concave slope** — the contour lines are spaced closer together at the top and further apart at the bottom. The slope is steep at the top and flattens out as you descend. Standing at the top, you can see the entire slope below you.

**Convex slope** — the contour lines are spaced further apart at the top and closer together at the bottom. The slope is gentle at the top and gets steeper as you descend. Standing at the top, you **cannot** see the bottom — the slope curves away from you, hiding what's below.

Convex slopes are dangerous for two reasons:

1. **You can't see hazards** — crags, steep drops, or obstacles are hidden below the curve.
2. **You can't judge distance** — the ground drops away faster than you expect, making it easy to overshoot your target.

When your route crosses a convex slope, take extra care. Slow down, check your bearing frequently, and use pacing to measure your distance.

> **Key point:** On a convex slope, you can't see what's below you. Treat them with extra caution.

![Side-view profiles of convex and concave slopes aligned with their contour spacing](media/lesson-7-2-slope-profiles.jpg)
<!-- MEDIA-TODO: Diagram showing side-view profiles of convex and concave slopes with matching contour line spacing -->

### Lesson: Ridges and spurs

<!-- duration: 6 -->

At Bronze you learned the V-shape rule for spurs and valleys. At Silver, you need to understand these features in more detail — because you'll be using them to navigate.

A **ridge** is a long, narrow crest of high ground. On the map, the contour lines run roughly parallel along both sides, with the highest ground in the centre. Ridges are excellent navigation features because:

- They give you a clear line to follow across high ground.
- You can see in both directions from the crest.
- They're easy to identify on the map and on the ground.

A **spur** is a ridge that sticks out from the main hillside. Think of it as a 'shoulder' of the hill. Spurs are useful as attack points — you can follow a spur uphill to reach a specific part of a summit area.

The key skill at Silver is matching what you see on the map to what you see on the ground. When you're standing on a ridge, can you identify which spur leads down to the burn? When you're in a valley, can you tell which re-entrant leads up to the col?

> **Key point:** Ridges and spurs give you natural lines to follow. Learn to match them between map and ground.

### Quiz: Reading the ground

<!-- passing_grade: 80 -->
<!-- feedback_mode: retry -->
<!-- questions_order: rand -->

#### Identify three knolls on this map.

<!-- type: image_answering -->
<!-- MEDIA-TODO: Scottish OS map extract showing several knolls as small closed contour rings -->

> **Explanation:** Knolls appear as one or two small closed contour rings, sometimes with a spot height. They're subtle — look for the small bumps, not the big summits.

#### You are walking downhill and the ground gets steeper as you descend. What type of slope are you on?

<!-- type: single_choice -->

- Concave
- * Convex
- Uniform
- Flat

> **Explanation:** On a convex slope, the gradient increases as you descend — gentle at the top, steep at the bottom. The ground curves away from you, hiding what's below.

#### What is the name for a small, shallow valley or fold in a hillside?

<!-- type: single_choice -->

- Knoll
- Col
- * Re-entrant
- Spur

> **Explanation:** A re-entrant is a small valley or fold where water collects and runs downhill. On the map, it appears as a small V-shape in the contour lines pointing uphill.

## Compass mastery

Advanced sighting and the geometry of error. This topic takes your compass skills from basic orientation to precision bearing work.

### Lesson: Taking a bearing (map to ground)

<!-- duration: 8 -->

At Bronze, you set the map and followed paths. At Silver, you take a **bearing** — a precise compass direction from where you are to where you want to go — and walk it across open ground.

The three-step process:

1. **Set the compass on the map.** Place the long edge of the baseplate so it connects your current position to your target. Make sure the direction-of-travel arrow points toward the target, not away from it.
2. **Rotate the housing.** Turn the compass housing until the orienting lines on the base of the housing are parallel with the north–south grid lines on the map, and the orienting arrow points to grid north (the top of the map).
3. **Read the bearing.** The number at the index line is your grid bearing in degrees.

Now lift the compass off the map, hold it flat in front of you at waist height, and rotate your whole body until the red needle sits inside the orienting arrow ('red in the shed'). The direction-of-travel arrow now points toward your target. Pick a visible feature on that line — a rock, a fence post, a patch of heather — and walk to it. Then repeat.

> **Key point:** Place, twist, read, turn. The four steps of taking and following a bearing.

![HD close-up of hands setting a compass on a map to take a bearing](media/lesson-8-1-taking-bearing.jpg)
<!-- MEDIA-TODO: HD close-up photo sequence showing hands placing a compass on a Scottish OS map, rotating the housing, and reading the bearing -->

### Lesson: The geometry of error (one in ten)

<!-- duration: 5 -->

No bearing is perfect. Even a small error in your compass reading sends you off course — and the further you walk, the worse it gets.

The rule of thumb is **one in ten**: for every degree of error, you'll be roughly 17m off target after 1km. That might not sound like much, but consider this:

- A 3° error over 1km puts you 50m off target — enough to miss a small knoll entirely.
- A 5° error over 2km puts you 175m off target — you could walk straight past a bothy and never see it.

Sources of error include:

- **Misaligning the compass on the map** — even a slight twist when placing the baseplate introduces error.
- **Misreading the bearing** — parallax (looking at the dial from an angle) can shift your reading by a degree or two.
- **Not holding the compass level** — a tilted compass gives a false needle reading.
- **Walking off line** — drifting left or right as you walk compounds the error.

The solution is to minimise error at every step: place the compass carefully, read the bearing from directly above, hold it level, and walk to intermediate features rather than trying to follow a bearing for a long distance in one go.

> **Key point:** Every degree of error costs you 17m per kilometre. Minimise error at every step.

![Cone diagram showing how bearing error grows over distance](media/lesson-8-2-error-cone.jpg)
<!-- MEDIA-TODO: Diagram showing a cone of error expanding over 1km and 2km, with displacement distances marked -->

### Lesson: Local deviation and parallax

<!-- duration: 5 -->

Your compass needle responds to any magnetic field — not just the Earth's. In the Scottish hills, there are several 'compass killers' to watch for:

- **Smartphones and electronics** — a phone in your jacket pocket can pull the needle several degrees off north. Keep electronics well away from the compass when taking a bearing.
- **Metal objects** — ice axes, trekking poles, belt buckles, and even the zip on your jacket can affect the needle. Hold the compass away from your body.
- **Magnetic rocks** — some Scottish mountains (particularly those with gabbro or basalt) contain magnetic minerals that deflect the needle. The Cuillin ridge on Skye is the most famous example, but it can happen anywhere.
- **Vehicles and fences** — metal fence posts and nearby vehicles create local magnetic fields. Step well away before taking a bearing.

**Parallax** is a different kind of error. If you read the compass dial from an angle rather than from directly above, you'll get a slightly different number. Always look straight down at the housing when reading your bearing.

> **Key point:** Keep electronics and metal away from your compass. Read the dial from directly above to avoid parallax.

<!-- MEDIA-TODO: Photo or video still showing a compass needle deflecting as a smartphone is brought close -->

### Quiz: The precision engineer

<!-- passing_grade: 80 -->
<!-- feedback_mode: retry -->
<!-- questions_order: rand -->

#### Your bearing is five degrees off over a 2km leg. Approximately how many metres will you miss your target by?

<!-- type: single_choice -->

- 85m
- * 170m
- 250m
- 50m

> **Explanation:** The 'one in ten' rule gives roughly 17m of displacement per degree per kilometre. Five degrees over 2km: 5 × 17 × 2 = 170m.

#### Which of these is most likely to deflect your compass needle in the Scottish hills?

<!-- type: single_choice -->

- A wooden fence post
- * A smartphone in your pocket
- A cotton rucksack strap
- A plastic water bottle

> **Explanation:** Smartphones contain magnets (in speakers and cases) and generate electromagnetic fields that can pull the compass needle off north. Keep them well away from the compass.

#### Put the steps for taking a map-to-ground bearing in the correct order.

<!-- type: ordering -->

1. Place the compass edge between your position and the target
2. Rotate the housing until orienting lines align with grid north
3. Read the bearing at the index line
4. Hold the compass flat and rotate your body until the needle sits in the orienting arrow
5. Walk toward a visible feature on the bearing line

> **Explanation:** Place, twist, read, turn, walk. Each step must be done carefully to minimise error.

## Distance, timing and pacing

Predicting your arrival and judging distance by eye. These skills turn you from someone who follows a bearing and hopes for the best into a navigator who knows exactly how far they've gone.

### Lesson: Naismith's rule and height gain

<!-- duration: 7 -->

**Naismith's rule** is the classic formula for estimating walking time in hilly terrain. It was devised by a Scottish mountaineer in 1892 and it's still the best quick estimate available:

- Allow **five kilometres per hour** on flat ground (or twelve minutes per kilometre).
- Add **one minute for every ten metres of ascent**.

So a 3km leg with 150m of climbing would take:

- Flat time: 3 × 12 = 36 minutes
- Climbing time: 150 ÷ 10 = 15 minutes
- **Total: 51 minutes**

Naismith's rule assumes a fit walker on reasonable ground. You'll need to adjust for:

- **Heavy packs** — add ten to twenty per cent for a full expedition rucksack.
- **Rough ground** — heather, bog, and tussock grass slow you down significantly. Add up to fifty per cent.
- **Poor visibility** — navigating in mist is slower because you stop more often to check your bearing.
- **Group fitness** — the group moves at the pace of the slowest member.

Some navigators also subtract time for steep descents (Tranter's corrections), but for DofE Silver, Naismith's rule is sufficient.

> **Key point:** Naismith's rule: 5km/h plus one minute per 10m of ascent. Adjust for conditions.

![Calculator graphic showing distance plus height equals time](media/lesson-10-1-naismith.jpg)
<!-- MEDIA-TODO: Infographic showing Naismith's rule calculation with a worked example on Scottish terrain -->

### Lesson: Pacing in practice

<!-- duration: 6 -->

**Pacing** is the technique of counting your steps to measure distance. It's your most reliable tool for knowing how far you've walked — especially in poor visibility when you can't see landmarks.

The method uses **double paces** (counting every time your left foot hits the ground):

1. Measure a 100m distance on flat ground (use a map or a measured path).
2. Walk it at your normal pace, counting every time your left foot lands.
3. Repeat three times and take the average. This is your **pace count** for 100m.

Most people get between 60 and 70 double paces per 100m on flat ground. Your count will change depending on:

- **Gradient** — uphill steps are shorter; your count goes up.
- **Surface** — heather, bog, and deep grass increase your count.
- **Fatigue** — your steps get shorter as you tire.
- **Pack weight** — a heavy rucksack shortens your stride.

To track your paces over longer distances, use a simple counting method: pick up a small stone every 100m, or tie knots in a cord. Some navigators use a **pacing bead** system — a cord with beads that you slide along as you complete each 100m.

> **Key point:** Know your pace count for 100m. Adjust it for gradient, surface, and conditions.

![Pacing card graphic showing bead and knot counting methods](media/lesson-10-2-pacing.jpg)
<!-- MEDIA-TODO: Graphic showing a pacing bead cord and a simple tally card, with example counts for different terrain -->

### Lesson: The Silver route card

<!-- duration: 8 -->

At Bronze, your route card recorded the five Ds for each leg. At Silver, you add three critical columns:

- **Bearing** — the compass bearing for each leg, in degrees.
- **Time** — the estimated walking time, calculated using Naismith's rule.
- **Pacing** — the expected pace count for the leg distance.

You should also add:

- **Escape routes** — for each leg, note the quickest safe route off the hill in case of emergency. This might be 'head south-west to the track in Glen X' or 'follow the burn downhill to the road.'
- **Grid references** — six-figure references for the start and end of every leg.

Think of the Silver route card as a **flight plan**. A pilot doesn't just point the plane in roughly the right direction — they calculate headings, distances, and times for every segment. Your route card does the same for your walk.

Before you set off, share your route card with your supervisor and leave a copy with someone who isn't on the expedition. If something goes wrong, the rescue team needs to know your planned route.

> **Key point:** The Silver route card adds bearing, time, pacing, and escape routes. It's your flight plan for the hills.

<!-- MEDIA-TODO: Side-by-side comparison of a Bronze route card (simple) and a Silver route card (with bearing, time, pacing, escape route columns) -->

### Quiz: The timekeeper

<!-- passing_grade: 80 -->
<!-- feedback_mode: retry -->
<!-- questions_order: rand -->

#### Using Naismith's rule, how long will a 1.5km leg with 50m of ascent take?

<!-- type: single_choice -->

- 18 minutes
- 20 minutes
- * 23 minutes
- 25 minutes

> **Explanation:** Flat time: 1.5 × 12 = 18 minutes. Climbing time: 50 ÷ 10 = 5 minutes. Total: 23 minutes.

#### Your pace count is 65 double paces per 100m on flat ground. How many double paces should you count for a 400m leg?

<!-- type: single_choice -->

- 195
- * 260
- 325
- 130

> **Explanation:** 65 paces per 100m × 4 = 260 double paces for 400m. In practice, adjust upward for rough ground or uphill.

#### Which of these should be added to a Silver route card but is NOT on a Bronze route card?

<!-- type: multiple_choice -->

- * Compass bearing in degrees
- Leg number
- * Escape route
- * Estimated time using Naismith's rule
- Description of terrain

> **Explanation:** Bronze route cards include leg number, description, and the five Ds. Silver adds precise compass bearings, Naismith timing, pacing counts, and escape routes.

## The Silver strategy (relocation and advanced tactics)

Technical navigation and what to do when 'displaced.' This topic covers the professional techniques that separate competent navigators from everyone else.

### Lesson: Attack points and aiming off

<!-- duration: 8 -->

Two techniques that transform your navigation in open country:

**Attack points**

An attack point is a large, easy-to-find feature near your actual target. Instead of trying to navigate directly to a small, hard-to-find feature (like a tiny lochan or a ruin), you navigate to the attack point first, then make a short, precise leg to your target.

For example, if you need to find a small bothy in a remote glen, don't try to walk a 2km bearing straight to it. Instead, navigate to the obvious stream junction 300m away (your attack point), then follow the burn upstream to the bothy. The stream junction is easy to find; the bothy on its own is not.

Good attack points are:

- Stream junctions
- The end of a wall or fence
- A prominent knoll or cairn
- A track junction
- The corner of a forestry plantation

**Aiming off**

Aiming off means deliberately aiming your bearing to one side of your target, so that when you reach a linear feature (a burn, a wall, a track), you know which way to turn.

Imagine you need to reach a bridge over a burn. If you aim straight at it and your bearing is slightly off, you'll hit the burn but not know whether the bridge is upstream or downstream. Instead, aim 5° to the left of the bridge. When you hit the burn, you know the bridge is to your right. Turn right and follow the burn until you find it.

> **Key point:** Use attack points to get close, then navigate precisely. Aim off so you always know which way to turn.

![Tactical map comparing a direct route versus a strategic route using an attack point and aiming off](media/lesson-9-1-attack-points.jpg)
<!-- MEDIA-TODO: Scottish OS map extract showing a direct bearing to a bothy versus a strategic route via an attack point with aiming off to a burn -->

### Lesson: The relocation protocol

<!-- duration: 8 -->

Every navigator gets 'displaced' sooner or later — you realise you don't know exactly where you are. The difference between a good navigator and a poor one is what happens next.

Follow the **relocation protocol** — a systematic process for working out where you are:

**Step one: stop.**
Don't keep walking. Every step you take while lost makes the problem worse.

**Step two: backtrack mentally.**
When did you last know exactly where you were? What have you done since then? How far have you walked? What bearing were you on? This narrows down the area you could be in.

**Step three: feature match.**
Look around you. What can you see? A burn? A knoll? A wall? Now look at the map in the area you think you are. Can you match what you see to what's on the map?

**Step four: aspect of slope.**
This is the Silver navigator's secret weapon. Set your map, then use your compass to measure the direction the slope is facing (its **aspect**). If the ground falls away to the north-east, find a slope on the map in your estimated area that also faces north-east. This dramatically narrows down your position.

To measure aspect of slope:

1. Stand facing directly downhill.
2. Take a compass bearing in the direction you're facing.
3. That bearing is the aspect of the slope you're standing on.
4. Find a matching slope on the map.

**Step five: if still uncertain, retreat.**
Go back to your last known position using a back-bearing. It's better to lose thirty minutes retracing your steps than to wander further into unknown ground.

> **Key point:** Stop, backtrack, feature match, aspect of slope, retreat. Follow the protocol — don't panic.

<!-- questions_order: rand -->

#### You need to reach a small knoll. There is a prominent forest corner 200m away from it. Should you take a direct bearing to the knoll or navigate to the forest corner first?

<!-- type: single_choice -->

- Direct bearing to the knoll
- * Navigate to the forest corner first (attack point)

> **Explanation:** The forest corner is a large, easy-to-find feature — a perfect attack point. Navigate there first, then make a short, precise leg to the knoll.

#### Put the relocation protocol steps in the correct order.

<!-- type: ordering -->

1. Stop walking
2. Backtrack mentally to your last known position
3. Feature match — compare what you see with the map
4. Aspect of slope — measure the direction the ground falls
5. If still uncertain, retreat to your last known position

> **Explanation:** The protocol is systematic: stop, think, look, measure, and if necessary retreat. Never keep walking when you're uncertain of your position.

#### You are aiming for a bridge over a burn. You deliberately aim your bearing five degrees to the left. When you reach the burn, which way do you turn to find the bridge?

<!-- type: single_choice -->

- Left (upstream)
- * Right (downstream)

> **Explanation:** If you aimed left of the bridge, you'll hit the burn upstream of it. Turn right (downstream) to find the bridge. This is the technique of 'aiming off.'

## The advanced route card

Documenting the journey for safety and leadership. This topic brings together everything from the course into a complete Silver-level route plan.

### Lesson: Building the Silver route card

<!-- duration: 8 -->

You've now learned all the skills that go into a Silver route card. Let's put them together.

For each leg of your route, record:

| Column | Example |
|---|---|
| Leg number | 3 |
| From (grid ref) | NN 384 157 — cairn on knoll |
| To (grid ref) | NN 391 163 — stream junction |
| Distance | 850m |
| Bearing | 042° |
| Height gain | 60m |
| Time (Naismith) | 16 min |
| Pace count | 553 (65 per 100m) |
| Description | NE across open moorland, rising gently. Cross one re-entrant after 400m. |
| Hazards | Boggy ground in re-entrant. Convex slope — can't see stream junction until 200m away. |
| Escape route | Head south to track in glen (bearing 180°, 1.2km) |

Before you set off:

1. **Check your bearings** — do they make sense? If leg two heads north and leg three heads south, have you made an error?
2. **Check your times** — add them up. Is the total realistic for your group?
3. **Check your escape routes** — can you get off the hill safely from every point on your route?
4. **Share the plan** — give a copy to your supervisor and leave one with a responsible person who isn't on the expedition.

> **Key point:** A complete Silver route card is your safety net. If you can write one, you can navigate anything.

### Lesson: Escape routes and emergency planning

<!-- duration: 5 -->

An **escape route** is a pre-planned way off the hill in case of emergency — injury, severe weather, equipment failure, or a member of the group becoming too tired to continue.

Good escape routes:

- Follow obvious features downhill (a burn, a ridge, a wall) to a road or track.
- Avoid crags, steep ground, and river crossings.
- Lead to a point where you can get help (a road, a bothy, a phone signal).

For every leg of your route, identify the nearest escape route and note it on your route card. Include:

- The bearing to follow
- The distance to safety
- The feature to follow (burn, wall, track)
- The destination (road name, bothy name, grid reference)

In a real emergency, you may need to abandon your planned route entirely. Having escape routes pre-planned means you can make that decision quickly and confidently, rather than trying to plan a new route under pressure.

> **Key point:** Plan your escape routes before you need them. In an emergency, you won't have time to think.

### Quiz: The route card challenge

<!-- passing_grade: 80 -->
<!-- feedback_mode: retry -->
<!-- questions_order: rand -->

#### Which of these should be included on a Silver route card but is NOT needed on a Bronze route card?

<!-- type: multiple_choice -->

- * Pace count for each leg
- * Escape route for each leg
- Leg number
- * Naismith time estimate
- Start and end waypoint names

> **Explanation:** Bronze route cards include leg numbers, waypoint names, and the five Ds. Silver adds pace counts, Naismith timing, and escape routes.

#### Your escape route follows a burn downhill to a road. The burn runs south-west. What bearing should you follow?

<!-- type: single_choice -->

- 135°
- 180°
- * 225°
- 270°

> **Explanation:** South-west is 225° on the compass. Following the burn on this bearing takes you downhill to the road.

## Final assessment

This assessment uses two real-world Scottish scenarios to test your Silver navigation skills. You need 85 per cent to pass.

### Quiz: The expert navigator

<!-- passing_grade: 85 -->
<!-- feedback_mode: retry -->
<!-- questions_order: rand -->

#### Scenario one: the moorland crossing — Your target is a tiny lochan 1.2km away across featureless moorland. Which strategy will you use to guarantee you don't miss it?

<!-- type: single_choice -->

- Walk on a direct bearing and hope for the best
- * Aim off to the burn 100m west of the lochan, then follow the burn to the lochan
- Walk faster to reduce the time for error to accumulate
- Use your phone GPS instead

> **Explanation:** Aiming off to the burn gives you a linear catching feature. When you hit the burn, turn right and follow it to the lochan. A direct bearing risks missing the target entirely.

#### Scenario one: the moorland crossing — Calculate the exact time for a 3km leg with 150m of ascent using Naismith's rule at 5km/h.

<!-- type: single_choice -->

- 36 minutes
- 45 minutes
- * 51 minutes
- 60 minutes

> **Explanation:** Flat time: 3km at 5km/h = 36 minutes. Climbing: 150m ÷ 10 = 15 minutes. Total: 51 minutes.

#### Scenario one: the moorland crossing — The mist comes down. You have walked 500m. The ground falls steeply to your north. On the map, there are two hills nearby. Which technique helps you work out which hill you are on?

<!-- type: single_choice -->

- Pacing
- Back-bearing
- * Aspect of slope
- Aiming off

> **Explanation:** Aspect of slope uses your compass to measure the direction the ground falls. If the slope faces north, find the hill on the map whose north side is steep. That's where you are.

#### Scenario two: the complex woodland — You need to find a small ruin hidden in thick forest. What is the best approach?

<!-- type: single_choice -->

- Walk a direct bearing from your current position
- * Navigate to the forest corner (attack point), then take a short bearing to the ruin
- Follow the edge of the forest until you see the ruin
- Use pacing alone

> **Explanation:** The forest corner is a large, obvious feature — a perfect attack point. Navigate there first, then make a short, precise leg to the ruin.

#### Scenario two: the complex woodland — A path junction is your last known point. You need to take a bearing to the ruin. Put the steps in order.

<!-- type: ordering -->

1. Place the compass edge between the path junction and the ruin on the map
2. Rotate the housing until the orienting lines align with grid north
3. Read the bearing at the index line
4. Hold the compass flat and rotate until the needle sits in the orienting arrow
5. Walk toward a visible feature on the bearing line

> **Explanation:** Place, twist, read, turn, walk. The standard five-step process for a map-to-ground bearing.

#### Scenario two: the complex woodland — You are moving between two knolls. You pass through a dip between two high points. What is the technical name for this feature?

<!-- type: single_choice -->

- Re-entrant
- Spur
- * Col (or saddle)
- Ridge

> **Explanation:** A col (also called a saddle) is the low point between two summits or knolls. It's a useful navigation feature because it's easy to identify on both the map and the ground.

#### Scenario two: the complex woodland — You are on the final 200m leg. Your pace count is 65 double paces per 100m. How many double paces must you count before you stop to look for the target?

<!-- type: single_choice -->

- 65
- * 130
- 195
- 260

> **Explanation:** 65 double paces per 100m × 2 = 130 double paces for 200m. When you reach 130, stop and look for the ruin.
