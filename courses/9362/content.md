# 3a. Navigation foundations

The Bronze Award is your first step into the world of independent exploration. This course strips away the mystery of the paper map, turning complex symbols and lines into a clear picture of the landscape around you. We focus on 'handrail' navigation — learning how to use paths, tracks, and field boundaries as your guide. By the end of this course, and combined with practical tuition, you won't just be following a group; you'll have the skills to plan your own journeys and navigate them with certainty.

## The language of the map

We look at different kinds of map and help you convert the 2D information on the sheet into a mental model of the real world.

### Lesson: The spectrum of maps

<!-- duration: 6 -->

Not all maps are created equal. Each type is designed for a different job, and picking the right one matters.

**Google Maps** is brilliant for driving directions, but zoom in on a hillside and you'll find almost nothing useful for a walker — no field boundaries, no contour detail, and no paths or tracks.

**Komoot and AllTrails** are great for inspiration. They show you popular routes and let you browse other people's adventures. But they rely on a phone signal and a charged battery, and the underlying map often lacks the fine detail you need when the path forks unexpectedly.

**Ordnance Survey 1:50,000** (the Landranger series with the pink cover) works well for cycling and getting a broad overview of an area. Roads and major paths stand out clearly, but smaller features like field boundaries and individual buildings start to disappear.

**OS 1:25,000** (the Explorer series with the orange cover) is the gold standard for walkers. Every wall, every fence line, every stream crossing is marked. Harvey maps offer a similar level of detail for popular Scottish mountain areas, printed on tough waterproof paper.

For your DofE expedition, the 1:25,000 map is your primary tool. It gives you the detail to navigate confidently even when the path isn't obvious on the ground.

> **Key point:** The more detail a map shows, the more useful it is when you leave the road. For walking, 1:25,000 is the scale you need.

<!-- MEDIA-TODO: 5-way split screen of the same hilltop across different map types -->

### Lesson: Decoding the symbols

<!-- duration: 6 -->

A map is a language. Once you learn the 'alphabet' of symbols, you can read the landscape without ever setting foot on it.

Map symbols fall into four broad families:

- **Linear symbols** — these follow lines across the map. Paths and tracks are the most important for walkers. A single dashed line shows a **path** (a narrow route on foot), while a pair of dashed lines shows a **track** (wider, often suitable for vehicles). Roads, railways, walls, and fences are all linear symbols too.
- **Area symbols** — these fill a region. Green shading with small tree symbols means woodland or forestry plantation. Yellow shading means open land. Blue shading means water (a loch or reservoir).
- **Point symbols** — these mark a single spot. A blue triangle is a trig point. A small black rectangle marks a building or bothy. A tiny dot with a number marks a spot height.
- **Water symbols** — burns and rivers are shown as thin blue lines. The line gets thicker as the watercourse grows. Marshland is shown with short horizontal blue lines.

Pay close attention to the **dashed line styles**. The difference between a path (single dashed line) and a track (double dashed lines) tells you a lot about what to expect on the ground. A track is usually wider and easier to follow; a path may be faint or overgrown in places.

In Scotland, the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003 gives you a broad **right of responsible access** to most land. You aren't restricted to marked rights of way as in England and Wales. However, the paths and tracks shown on the map are still your best guide to practical routes.

Every OS map includes a full legend on the cover. Keep it handy until the common symbols become second nature.

> **Key point:** Learn the four symbol families — linear, area, point, and water — and you can decode any OS map. In Scotland, focus on the difference between paths and tracks.

<!-- MEDIA-TODO: Comparison of dashed line styles for path (single dash), track (double dash), and minor road, each paired with a real-world photo from Scottish terrain -->

### Lesson: Scale and space

<!-- duration: 5 -->

**Scale** tells you the relationship between a distance on the map and the same distance on the ground.

On a 1:25,000 map, everything is shrunk by a factor of twenty-five thousand. That sounds complicated, but there's a simple shortcut: **4cm on the map equals 1km on the ground**.

The blue grid lines printed on every OS Explorer map are spaced exactly 4cm apart, which means each grid square represents exactly 1km × 1km on the ground. You can use these squares to estimate distances quickly:

1. Count the number of full grid squares your route crosses.
2. Add a fraction for any partial square at the start or end.
3. That gives you a rough distance in kilometres.

For a more precise measurement, use a piece of string laid along your route, then hold it against the scale bar at the bottom of the map.

> **Key point:** On a 1:25,000 map, 4cm equals 1km. Each blue grid square is one square kilometre.

![Photo of a 1km road next to a map snippet with a ruler overlay showing 4cm](media/lesson-1-3-scale-ruler.jpg)

<!-- questions_order: rand -->

#### Match each symbol to its real-world feature.

<!-- type: matching -->

- Single dashed line = Path
- Double dashed lines = Track
- Blue triangle = Trig point
- Green shading with tree symbols = Woodland or forestry plantation
- Small black rectangle = Building or bothy

> **Explanation:** Linear symbols like paths and tracks are shown as dashed lines — single for a path, double for a track. Point symbols mark individual features such as trig points and buildings.

#### 8cm on a 1:25,000 map represents how far on the ground?

<!-- type: single_choice -->

- 1km
- * 2km
- 4km
- 500m

> **Explanation:** At 1:25,000 scale, 4cm equals 1km. So 8cm equals 2km.

#### Click on the symbol that represents a track rather than a path.

<!-- type: image_answering -->
<!-- MEDIA-TODO: Map snippet showing path, track, minor road, and major road symbols from a Scottish OS map -->

> **Explanation:** A track is shown as a pair of dashed lines and is usually wide enough for a vehicle. A path is shown as a single dashed line and is narrower.

## Where are you?

Tools for locating yourself, and how to communicate your location on a paper map.

### Lesson: The tool spectrum (digital versus paper)

<!-- duration: 6 -->

Your phone is an incredible navigation tool — until it isn't.

Phones fail in predictable ways:

- **Battery** — GPS, screen brightness, and cold weather drain power fast. A full charge in the morning can be dead by lunchtime on a winter walk.
- **Cold** — lithium batteries lose capacity in low temperatures. Your phone might shut down at twenty per cent in freezing conditions.
- **Signal** — many walking areas in the UK have patchy or no mobile signal. Offline maps help, but they still need battery.
- **Fragility** — one slip on a wet rock and your screen is cracked.

A paper map and compass have none of these problems. They work in the rain, in the cold, and they never run out of battery. That's why DofE expeditions require you to navigate with paper and compass.

This doesn't mean phones are useless. A phone is a brilliant backup and emergency tool. But your **primary** navigation should always be paper and compass in the hills.

> **Key point:** Paper maps and compasses are reliable in all conditions. Use your phone as a backup, not your main tool.

![Reliability scorecard comparing phone and paper map across battery, weather, signal, and durability](media/lesson-2-1-reliability-scorecard.jpg)
<!-- MEDIA-TODO: Infographic comparing phone vs paper reliability across four categories -->

### Lesson: The four-figure box

<!-- duration: 4 -->

A **grid reference** is the map's postcode system. It lets you describe any location on the map using numbers.

Start with four-figure grid references. The rule is simple: **'along the corridor, then up the stairs'**.

1. Find the vertical grid line on the **left** side of your target square. Read the two-digit number printed along the bottom of the map. This is your **easting**.
2. Find the horizontal grid line at the **bottom** of your target square. Read the two-digit number printed up the side of the map. This is your **northing**.
3. Put them together: easting first, then northing.

A four-figure grid reference like **NN 38 15** identifies a 1km × 1km square. That's good enough to tell someone roughly where you are — like saying 'I'm in the square that contains the bothy.'

> **Key point:** Eastings first (along the corridor), then northings (up the stairs). A four-figure reference identifies a 1km square.

![Animated map overlay showing fingers moving along eastings then up northings](media/lesson-2-2-grid-reference.jpg)
<!-- MEDIA-TODO: Annotated map showing easting and northing reading sequence -->

### Lesson: Six-figure precision

<!-- duration: 6 -->

A four-figure reference gets you to the right square kilometre. A **six-figure reference** pinpoints you to within 100 metres — accurate enough to identify a specific bridge, bothy, or cairn.

The trick is to slice each 1km grid square into ten equal strips in each direction:

1. Start with your four-figure reference (the easting and northing of the bottom-left corner).
2. Estimate how many **tenths** across the square your point sits. Add this digit to the easting.
3. Estimate how many **tenths** up the square your point sits. Add this digit to the northing.

So if the bottom-left corner is **38 15**, and your point is three-tenths across and seven-tenths up, the six-figure reference is **383 157**.

A **roamer** (a small plastic scale printed on your compass or bought separately) makes estimating tenths much easier. Line it up with the grid lines and read off the extra digit directly.

> **Key point:** A six-figure grid reference adds one digit of precision to each axis, pinpointing you to a 100m × 100m area.

![High-resolution zoom of one grid square with a roamer scale overlay](media/lesson-2-3-roamer.jpg)

<!-- feedback_mode: retry -->
<!-- questions_order: rand -->

#### Identify the four-figure grid reference for the square containing the windmill.

<!-- type: image_answering -->
<!-- MEDIA-TODO: Map extract with a windmill symbol in a clearly identifiable grid square -->

> **Explanation:** Read the easting of the left-hand grid line first ('along the corridor'), then the northing of the bottom grid line ('up the stairs').

#### Put the steps for reading a six-figure grid reference in the correct order.

<!-- type: ordering -->

1. Read the easting (left-hand grid line number)
2. Estimate tenths across the square
3. Read the northing (bottom grid line number)
4. Estimate tenths up the square

> **Explanation:** Always start with the easting, add the tenths digit, then move to the northing and add its tenths digit.

## The wrinkly Earth

How the map represents 3D terrain on a 2D sheet.

### Lesson: Introducing contour lines

<!-- duration: 5 -->

The landscape has bumps, dips, and slopes. A flat paper map shows these using **contour lines** — imaginary lines that connect points of equal height.

On a 1:25,000 OS map:

- Contour lines are drawn at **5m vertical intervals** (thin orange-brown lines).
- Every fifth line (at 25m intervals) is drawn thicker and labelled with its height. These are called **index contours**.
- The numbers on index contours are printed so they read uphill — the top of the number points toward higher ground.

The **spacing** between contour lines tells you how steep the ground is:

- **Close together** = steep slope
- **Far apart** = gentle slope or flat ground

Imagine slicing a potato horizontally at regular intervals and looking down at the slices from above. Each slice edge is a contour line. That's exactly what the map is showing you.

> **Key point:** Contour lines join points of equal height. Close lines mean steep ground; wide spacing means gentle ground.

![3D model of a hill side by side with its 2D contour representation](media/lesson-3-1-contour-3d.jpg)
<!-- MEDIA-TODO: 3D hill model alongside its 2D contour map representation -->

### Lesson: Spurs, valleys, and summits

<!-- duration: 6 -->

Once you can read contour spacing, you can start recognising **landforms** — the shapes that hills and valleys make.

Three key shapes to learn:

- **Summit** — closed concentric rings, getting smaller toward the centre. The innermost ring is the highest point. Often marked with a spot height or trig point.
- **Valley** — contour lines form a V-shape pointing **uphill** (toward higher ground). Water flows down the centre of the V. If you see a blue stream line, it confirms you're looking at a valley.
- **Spur** — contour lines form a V-shape pointing **downhill** (toward lower ground). A spur is a ridge of high ground sticking out from a hillside. Think of it as the opposite of a valley.

The **V-shape rule** is the key:

- V points uphill → valley (water flows down)
- V points downhill → spur (high ground sticks out)

With practice, you'll be able to look at a map and 'see' the hills, valleys, and ridges in your mind's eye — like switching from 2D to 3D.

> **Key point:** Learn the V-shape rule. V pointing uphill means a valley; V pointing downhill means a spur.

![Photos of real landforms with contour lines drawn over the top in orange](media/lesson-3-2-landforms.jpg)
<!-- MEDIA-TODO: Real landscape photos with contour overlays showing valley, spur, and summit -->

### Quiz: The 3D vision test

<!-- passing_grade: 80 -->
<!-- feedback_mode: retry -->
<!-- questions_order: rand -->

#### Match each contour pattern to the correct landform name.

<!-- type: matching -->

- V-shape pointing uphill = Valley
- V-shape pointing downhill = Spur
- Closed concentric rings = Summit

> **Explanation:** The V-shape rule is the quickest way to tell valleys from spurs. Closed rings always indicate a high point.

## The magic needle

Finding your direction and how to use a compass effectively.

### Lesson: Choosing your compass

<!-- duration: 5 -->

There are several types of compass, but only one is really suited to map navigation.

- **Button compass** — tiny, cheap, and clips onto a jacket. Good for a rough sense of direction, but useless for precise work.
- **Lensatic (military) compass** — rugged and accurate for sighting, but has no transparent base for map work.
- **Digital compass** — built into your phone or watch. Convenient, but depends on battery and can be thrown off by nearby electronics.
- **Baseplate compass** — the navigator's tool of choice. It has a transparent rectangular base that sits flat on the map, a rotating housing with degree markings, and a magnetic needle. The transparency lets you see the map through the compass while you work.

For DofE and hill walking, a **baseplate compass** is what you need. The Silva Expedition or similar models are ideal. Look for one with a roamer scale on the baseplate for reading six-figure grid references.

> **Key point:** A baseplate compass is the right tool for map navigation because its transparent base lets you work directly on the map.

![Gallery of four compass types with pros and cons labels](media/lesson-4-1-compass-types.jpg)
<!-- MEDIA-TODO: Side-by-side images of button, lensatic, digital, and baseplate compasses with pros/cons -->

### Lesson: Anatomy of the baseplate

<!-- duration: 4 -->

Before you use a compass, you need to know its parts.

Pick up your baseplate compass and find these features:

- **Baseplate** — the flat, transparent rectangle. It has a direction-of-travel arrow printed along its length and ruler markings along the edges.
- **Housing** (also called the capsule) — the round, rotating dial in the centre. It's filled with liquid to dampen the needle and has degree markings (0–360) around the edge.
- **Magnetic needle** — the needle floating inside the housing. The **red end** always points toward magnetic north. The white (or black) end points south.
- **Orienting lines** — parallel lines printed on the floor of the housing. When you rotate the housing, these lines move with it.
- **Orienting arrow** — a large arrow outline printed on the floor of the housing, aligned with the orienting lines.
- **Index line** — the small mark on the housing rim where you read your bearing, aligned with the direction-of-travel arrow.

> **Key point:** Learn the five main parts: baseplate, housing, needle, orienting lines/arrow, and index line.

![Labelled high-resolution photo of a baseplate compass](media/lesson-4-2-compass-anatomy.jpg)
<!-- MEDIA-TODO: Annotated photo of a baseplate compass with all parts labelled -->

### Lesson: Setting the map (red to the shed)

<!-- duration: 6 -->

**Setting** (or **orienting**) the map means rotating it so that north on the map points to north in the real world. Once the map is set, everything on it lines up with the landscape around you — left on the map is left on the ground, and the bothy symbol on the map is in the same direction as the real bothy.

Here's how to set your map:

1. Hold the map flat in front of you.
2. Place your compass on the map with the direction-of-travel arrow pointing toward the top (north edge) of the map.
3. Rotate your body and the map together until the **red end** of the needle lines up with the north–south grid lines on the map.

The memory aid is **'red to the shed'** — the red needle points to the grid lines (the 'shed' of parallel lines on the map).

Once the map is set, resist the temptation to turn it back to read the text. Keep it oriented and read the symbols instead. A set map is your most powerful navigation tool.

> **Key point:** Rotate your body and map until the red needle aligns with the grid lines. Now the map matches the landscape.

### Quiz: The navigator's instrument

<!-- passing_grade: 80 -->
<!-- feedback_mode: retry -->
<!-- questions_order: rand -->

#### Label the parts of the compass shown in the image.

<!-- type: matching -->
<!-- MEDIA-TODO: Unlabelled compass photo with numbered arrows pointing to parts -->

- 1 = Baseplate
- 2 = Housing
- 3 = Magnetic needle
- 4 = Orienting arrow
- 5 = Index line

> **Explanation:** Knowing the parts of your compass by name helps you follow instructions quickly in the field.

#### Which part of the needle aligns with grid north when you set the map?

<!-- type: single_choice -->

- The white end
- * The red end
- Both ends equally
- Neither — you use the orienting arrow

> **Explanation:** The red end of the magnetic needle points toward north. When setting the map, you align this red end with the north–south grid lines.

## Planning the mission

This topic covers route planning techniques, breaking your journey into manageable legs and thinking about how you will keep track of your progress.

### Lesson: The five Ds of a leg

<!-- duration: 7 -->

Every journey can be broken into short sections called **legs**. Each leg takes you from one identifiable point to the next. Before you walk a leg, you need to think about five things — the **five Ds**:

1. **Destination** — where are you heading? Identify a clear feature on the map: a junction, a bridge, a gate, a stream crossing.
2. **Distance** — how far is it? Measure the leg on the map using the grid squares or a roamer.
3. **Direction** — which way do you need to go? For Bronze, this is usually 'follow the path,' but note whether you're heading broadly north, south, east, or west.
4. **Description** — what will you see along the way? Note the terrain: 'path through forestry plantation,' 'track alongside a stone wall,' 'open moorland with burn on the left.'
5. **Dangers** — are there any hazards? A road crossing, a steep descent, a burn in spate, or boggy ground.

Writing down the five Ds for each leg before you set off gives you a clear plan. If something doesn't match what you expected, you know immediately that something is wrong.

> **Key point:** Before walking any leg, work out the five Ds: destination, distance, direction, description, and dangers.

![Graphic showing a map leg with labels for each of the five Ds](media/lesson-5-1-five-ds.jpg)
<!-- MEDIA-TODO: Annotated map showing a single leg with the five Ds labelled -->

### Lesson: The journey workflow (legs and route cards)

<!-- duration: 8 -->

A walk is like a book — it's made up of chapters. Each chapter is a **leg**, and the point where one leg ends and the next begins is a **waypoint**.

Good waypoints are features you can identify both on the map and on the ground:

- A path junction
- A gate or deer fence crossing
- A bridge over a burn
- A distinctive bend in a wall or fence

Once you've identified your waypoints, you can write a **route card**. A route card is a table that records the five Ds for every leg of your journey. Think of it as the group's script — everyone can follow the plan, and if the navigator gets confused, anyone in the group can pick up where they left off.

A basic route card has columns for:

- Leg number
- From (start waypoint)
- To (end waypoint)
- Distance
- Direction (bearing or general compass direction)
- Description of the route
- Hazards or notes

Route cards are not just a DofE requirement — they're a genuine safety tool. If you need to call for help, you can give the rescue team your planned route and your last known position.

> **Key point:** Break your walk into legs between clear waypoints. Record the five Ds for each leg on a route card.

![A 3km route divided by circles at waypoints and arrows showing legs](media/lesson-5-2-route-card.jpg)
<!-- MEDIA-TODO: Map showing a route divided into legs with waypoint markers -->

### Lesson: Handrails and catching features

<!-- duration: 5 -->

Two simple techniques make path navigation much more reliable.

A **handrail** is a linear feature that runs alongside or parallel to your route. Instead of constantly checking the map, you follow the handrail and let it guide you. Common handrails include:

- A wall or fence running in your direction of travel
- A stream or river
- The edge of a wood
- A track or path

A **catching feature** is a large, unmissable feature that tells you you've gone too far. It's your safety net. If you reach the catching feature, you know you've overshot your waypoint and need to turn back.

For example, if your waypoint is a path junction and there's a major road 500m beyond it, that road is your catching feature. If you hit tarmac, you've missed the junction.

Together, handrails and catching features give you confidence. The handrail keeps you on track; the catching feature stops you wandering off into the unknown.

> **Key point:** Follow handrails to stay on course. Identify catching features so you know if you've gone too far.

![Map snippet highlighting a path with a stream handrail and a road as a catching feature](media/lesson-5-3-handrails.jpg)
<!-- MEDIA-TODO: Annotated map showing a handrail (stream) and catching feature (road) -->

#### Look at the map. What catching feature stops you if you miss the path junction?

<!-- type: image_answering -->
<!-- MEDIA-TODO: Map extract showing a path junction with a river beyond it -->

> **Explanation:** A catching feature is a large, unmissable feature beyond your target. In this case, the river acts as a safety net — if you reach it, you've gone too far.

## Final assessment

Let's bring it all together. This assessment uses two real-world scenarios to test your Bronze navigation skills.

### Quiz: The hill-ready exam

<!-- passing_grade: 80 -->
<!-- feedback_mode: retry -->
<!-- questions_order: rand -->

#### Scenario one: the forest trail — You find an injured walker near a ruin in a forestry plantation. Identify the six-figure grid reference for the rescue team.

<!-- type: image_answering -->
<!-- MEDIA-TODO: Map extract showing a ruin symbol inside a forestry plantation in Scotland -->

> **Explanation:** Read the easting and estimate tenths across, then read the northing and estimate tenths up. Accuracy matters when directing a mountain rescue team.

#### Scenario one: the forest trail — You have a 1.2km leg along a path. If you are walking at 4km/h, how long should this leg take?

<!-- type: single_choice -->

- 12 minutes
- 15 minutes
- * 18 minutes
- 20 minutes

> **Explanation:** At 4km/h you cover 1km in fifteen minutes. 1.2km takes fifteen minutes plus three more (0.2 × 15), giving eighteen minutes.

#### Scenario one: the forest trail — The path follows a stream. What is the technical name for using this stream to guide you?

<!-- type: single_choice -->

- Catching feature
- Attack point
- * Handrail
- Bearing line

> **Explanation:** A handrail is a linear feature that runs alongside your route and guides your navigation.

#### Scenario two: the glen walk — You come to a track junction near a farm. Based on the stone walls and farm buildings shown in the photo, is your map oriented correctly?

<!-- type: true_false -->
<!-- MEDIA-TODO: Photo of a Scottish farm track junction alongside a map snippet, one correctly oriented -->

- * True
- False

> **Explanation:** When your map is set correctly, the features on the map line up with what you see on the ground. Stone walls and buildings are reliable reference points.

#### Scenario two: the glen walk — You are heading toward a bothy. If you reach a major road, have you gone too far? What is this road called in navigation terms?

<!-- type: single_choice -->

- Handrail
- * Catching feature
- Attack point
- Waypoint

> **Explanation:** A catching feature is a large, unmissable feature beyond your target that tells you you've overshot.

#### Scenario two: the glen walk — The path climbs steeply toward a viewpoint above the glen. Based on the map snippet, is the landform you are standing on a spur or a valley?

<!-- type: single_choice -->
<!-- MEDIA-TODO: Map snippet from a Scottish glen showing contour lines forming a spur -->

- * Spur
- Valley

> **Explanation:** Look at the V-shape of the contour lines. If the V points downhill (toward lower ground), you're on a spur — a ridge of high ground sticking out from the hillside.
