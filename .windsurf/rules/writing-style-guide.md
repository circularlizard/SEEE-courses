# SEEE Writing Style Guide

## Overview
This style guide ensures consistent, clear, and engaging content across all SEEE (South East Explorers Expeditions) materials. Based on British English standards and Scouts communication principles.

## Language and Spelling

### British English Standards
- Use British spellings: `colour`, `honour`, `favour`, `centre`, `organise`, `realise`, `analyse`
- Use `-ise` endings: `organise`, `realise`, `recognise` (not `-ize`)
- Use `-our` endings: `colour`, `honour`, `favour` (not `-or`)
- Use `-re` endings: `centre`, `theatre`, `metre` (not `-er`)
- Double consonants: `traveller`, `cancelled`, `focussed` (not single `l`)

### Capitalisation
- Use sentence case for headings and titles
- Capitalise proper nouns only: `Scouts`, `British Scouts`, `Explorers`
- Do not capitalise generic terms: `leaders`, `members`, `activities`
- Job titles: lowercase unless preceding a name: `section leader David` vs `David, section leader`

## Numbers and Dates

### Numbers
- Spell out numbers one to ninety-nine
- Use figures for 100 and above
- Use commas in thousands: `1,234`, `10,000`
- Use figures for ages: `8 years old`, `aged 12`
- Use figures for measurements: `5km`, `2 hours`, £25

### Dates and Times
- Format: `5 February 2024` (day month year)
- Use `2020s` (not 2020's)
- Times: `9am`, `5.30pm` (no colons, lowercase)
- Decades: `1990s` (not 1990's)

## Punctuation

### General Rules
- Use Oxford comma for clarity: `leaders, members, and volunteers`
- Single quotes for emphasis, double quotes for direct speech
- Use en dash (–) for ranges: `2020–2024`, `pages 15–20`
- No full stop after abbreviations: `Dr`, `Mr`, `St` (but `etc.`)

### Specific Usage
- Exclamation marks: use sparingly, maximum one per paragraph
- Hyphens: `well-being`, `decision-making`, `team-building`
- Percentages: `10 per cent` (spelled out), not `10%`

## Tone and Voice

### Scouts-Inspired Principles
- **Friendly and approachable**: Use warm, inclusive language
- **Clear and simple**: Avoid jargon and complex terminology
- **Active voice**: "We encourage" rather than "Encouragement is given"
- **Positive focus**: Emphasise benefits and opportunities
- **Inclusive**: Use gender-neutral language where possible

### Word Choice
- Use simple, everyday words: `help` instead of `assist`, `show` instead of `demonstrate`
- Avoid corporate jargon: `synergy`, `leverage`, `paradigm`
- Use contractions sparingly: `it's`, `you're` (maintain professional tone)
- Prefer concrete language: `10 young people` instead of `a number of participants`

## Structure and Formatting

### Headings
- Use clear, descriptive headings
- Maximum 60 characters for main headings
- Use sentence case for all headings
- Include keywords for searchability

### Paragraphs
- Keep paragraphs short: 2-4 sentences maximum
- Use subheadings to break up long content
- Include bullet points for lists of 3+ items
- Use bold for emphasis, not italics

### Lists
- Use bullet points for non-sequential items
- Use numbered lists for step-by-step instructions
- Start each bullet point with a capital letter
- Use consistent punctuation at end of bullet points

## Specific SEEE Guidelines

### Expedition Content
- Use `expedition` (lowercase) when referring generally
- Capitalise specific expedition names: `Duke of Edinburgh's Award Expedition`
- Reference locations with full names first: `Peak District National Park`, then `the Peak District`

### Safety and Guidelines
- Use clear, direct language for safety instructions
- Include action words: `Ensure`, `Check`, `Follow`
- Use imperative mood for instructions: `Wear appropriate footwear`

### Inclusive Language
- Use `young people` rather than `boys` or `girls`
- Use `leaders` or `volunteers` rather than `helpers`
- Avoid assumptions about experience or ability
- Use `they/them` for singular gender-neutral references

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Spelling
- `center` → `centre`
- `organize` → `organise`
- `color` → `colour`
- `traveler` → `traveller`

### Grammar
- `different to` → `different from`
- `less items` → `fewer items`
- `between` (two items) vs `among` (three+ items)

### Style
- Overuse of capital letters
- Multiple exclamation marks
- Complex sentence structures
- Corporate buzzwords
