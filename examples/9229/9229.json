They should be turned off in a sealed bag ideally with the first aid kit.<\/li><li>Phoning or messaging your parents \/ boyfriend \/ girlfriend, catching up on the football scores and so on are not generally good reasons to get your phone out.<\/li><li>If you need to take photos or videos for your project, consider getting a single purpose device<\/li><li>This is the suggested policy.
