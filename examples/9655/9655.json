Clothing Strategy: 'One to Wear, One to Spare'<\/h3><p>A common mistake is packing a fresh outfit for every day. For Gold, you only need:<\/p><ul><li><strong>Day Clothes:<\/strong> What you stand up in (Boots, socks, trousers, base layer, fleece).<\/li><li><strong>Night\/Spare Clothes:<\/strong> One full dry set (dry socks, dry base layer top & bottoms). Keep these in a dry bag.<\/li><li><strong>Safety:<\/strong> Waterproofs and a hat\/gloves.<\/li><\/ul><p><em>Rule:<\/em> If your day clothes get wet, you put wet clothes back on in the morning. Keep your dry set strictly for camp\/sleeping.<\/p><h3>2. Equipment Choices<\/h3><ul><li><strong>Sleeping Bags:<\/strong> A down bag is lighter and packs smaller than synthetic but is useless if it gets wet. If you are careful with dry bags, down is a great weight saver.<\/li><li><strong>Tents:<\/strong> Don't just carry your own tent. Split the weight! One person takes poles\/pegs, the other takes the flysheet\/inner.<\/li><li><strong>Toiletries:<\/strong> Decant everything. You need 50ml of toothpaste, not a full tube. Use a micro-fibre travel towel, not a bathroom towel.<\/li><\/ul><h3>3. What NOT to Bring<\/h3><ul><li><strong>Jeans\/Hoodies:<\/strong> Heavy, cotton, useless when wet. Banned.<\/li><li><strong>Full Wash Bag:<\/strong> Deodorant cans, glass perfume bottles, full-sized shampoo.<\/li><li><strong>Gadgets:<\/strong> Big power banks (unless for nav), hardback books, speakers.<\/li><li><strong>Spare Shoes:<\/strong> Unless they are ultra-light flip flops for camp, stick to your boots.<\/li><\/ul><h3>4. Multi-Use Items<\/h3><ul><li><strong>Buff\/Neck Gaiter:<\/strong> Can be a hat, scarf, pot grab, or eye mask.<\/li><li><strong>Spork:<\/strong> Replace a knife, fork, and spoon with one light item.<\/li><li><strong>Mug:<\/strong> Eat your dinner out of your mug to save carrying a bowl.<\/li><\/ul>",
