A\u00a010\u00b0C day with a 30mph wind feels like 5.5\u00b0C, as it literally wicks energy away from your body. This drains your body\u2019s core temperature and your energy reserves.<\/li><li><strong>Wind makes life harder<\/strong><ul><li>20-30mph: Hard work. You'll need to shout to be heard.<\/li><li>40-50mph: Dangerous for DofE. Gusts will knock you off balance, especially with a heavy 65L rucksack.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li><strong>The Venturi Effect<\/strong>: Wind accelerates when forced through narrow gaps. A steady breeze in the valley can become a gale-force wind as it \"funnels\" through a narrow glen or over a pass.<\/li><li><strong>The Multiplier Effect:<\/strong><ul><li><strong>Wind + Sun:<\/strong> Strong winds can mask the heat of the sun. You won't feel yourself burning until it's too late. Keep the suncream on!<\/li><li><strong>Wind + Rain<\/strong>: This is the \"Hypothermia Combo.\" Wind drives rain through your waterproof seals and makes \"horizontal rain\" that hits your face and eyes, making navigation nearly a lot harder.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li><strong>Decision Fatigue<\/strong>: Fighting the wind while carrying a heavy 65L rucksack is exhausting. When you are tired, your navigation suffers. Many \"lost\" groups aren't bad at maps; they are just exhausted.<\/li><\/ul>",

If you get wet, your body uses massive amounts of energy just to stay warm.<\/p><p><strong>\"Cotton is Rotten\":<\/strong> Never wear cotton t-shirts or hoodies on expedition. Cotton absorbs water, stays heavy, and dries incredibly slowly. Most importantly, it stops insulating and starts sucking heat away from your body. Stick to synthetic or wool base layers.<\/p><p><strong>Types of Rain:<\/strong><\/p><ul><li><strong>\"The Clag\" (Drizzle\/Mizzle):<\/strong> Fine, persistent rain that sticks to everything and reduces visibility. Often caused by low Stratus clouds.<\/li><li><strong>Heavy Showers:<\/strong> Sharp, intense bursts of rain often followed by sun. These are common in the West.<\/li><li><strong>Horizontal Rain:<\/strong> Caused by high winds driving rain sideways. It will find every gap in your waterproofs.<\/li><\/ul><p><strong>Slippery Progress:<\/strong> Rain makes Highland rock and \"black bog\" incredibly slippery. Expect your walking speed to drop by half.<\/p><h3>Cloud Indicators: Look up!<\/h3><p><strong>Stratus:<\/strong> Low, grey, \"blanket\" clouds that bring persistent drizzle and hide your landmarks.<\/p><p><strong>Cumulonimbus:<\/strong> Towering \"anvil\" clouds.

Check for the \"Umbles\": Stumbling, Mumbling, Fumbling, and Grumbling. These are early signs of cold exhaustion.<\/p><\/li><li><p><strong>Be Bold, Start Cold:<\/strong> Don't start hiking in your big fleece. You'll sweat, get damp, and then freeze when you stop. Start with just a base layer and waterproof; add layers only when you stop.<\/p><\/li><\/ul>",
